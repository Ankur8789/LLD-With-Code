# Low Level Design (LLD) – Design Patterns 🚀

This repository contains my **learning, implementation, and notes on Low Level Design (LLD) concepts and design patterns**.  
The goal is to build a **strong foundation in object-oriented design**, understand **when and why to use design patterns**, and write **clean, scalable, and maintainable code**.

This repo is intended for:

- Interview preparation (LLD rounds)
- Improving real-world design skills
- Revising common design patterns with working code

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

### 1️⃣ Object-Oriented Design Principles

- SOLID Principles
- DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- Composition vs Inheritance
- Dependency Injection
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism

---

### 2️⃣ Creational Design Patterns

| Pattern          | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Singleton        | Ensures a class has only one instance                |
| Factory          | Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic |
| Abstract Factory | Factory of factories                                 |
| Builder          | Constructs complex objects step-by-step              |
| Prototype        | Creates object copies efficiently                    |

### 3️⃣ Structural Design Patterns

| Pattern   | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Adapter   | Bridges incompatible interfaces                   |
| Decorator | Adds behavior dynamically                         |
| Facade    | Simplifies complex subsystems                     |
| Composite | Treats individual and composite objects uniformly |
| Proxy     | Controls access to an object                      |
| Flyweight | Optimizes memory usage                            |

### 4️⃣ Behavioral Design Patterns

| Pattern                 | Description                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Observer                | One-to-many dependency updates   |
| Strategy                | Switch algorithms at runtime     |
| Command                 | Encapsulates requests as objects |
| State                   | Changes behavior based on state  |
| Chain of Responsibility | Passes request along a chain     |
| Iterator                | Traverses collections safely     |
| Mediator                | Centralized object communication |
| Template Method         | Defines algorithm skeleton       |

### 5️⃣ Common LLD Case Studies (Planned / In Progress)

- Parking Lot System
- Elevator System
- Snake and Ladder
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Cache (LRU / LFU)
- ATM Machine
- Library Management System

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Languages

- Language: **C++ / Java / TypeScript (depending on implementation)**
- Design Focus: **Clean Code, OOP, extensibility**
- No heavy frameworks — pure design-first approach
